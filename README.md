Generated a portfolio page to add to my work as the course progresses. A portfolio of work will be used to showcase skills and talents to employers looking to fill a position. First challenge has been linked for now as several deployed projects with intention to update link with future work completed.
This challenged allowed for recently learned skills such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to be used.
